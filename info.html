      <h2>Features in MoodMatch</h2>
      <p>MoodMatch has a vast music catalog, from pop music to underground music in your hometown.
         Not only do we have recommended music for you we also have curated playlists for users. 
         What makes us different from other services is that 
         we can recomend song/podcasts/books/tv-series/movies based on your mood. 
         In the previous page we mentioned a quiz you must do inorder to sign in, 
         well that quiz has detailed questions which helps us figure out how to recommend earlier mentioned data to you.
         With the quiz we build a persona and we continue to configure the data you consume. 
         We can recommend data that is similar to what you consume so that you can have a new experience with a similar theme. 
         Our greatest feature is our translation feature. 
         With the help of AI we can translate to many different languages as well as dialects. 
         The AI in our service can also explain the context of the media you are currently viewing.
