         <p>With this service we focus to help anyone who finds themselves scrolling endlessly.
            This service provides you with what you need almost instantly. 
            To get accurate data on your moods youâ€™d have to complete a survey when you first sign up to be a user.
            Then it follows patterns of the data you consume.
            You can skip the survey if you link up all your other services to MoodMatch.
            The idea is to create a digital community which helps introverts and others who find it hard making friends in regu-lar places.
            It is a service that allows people to find likeminded people all over the world. 
            With the aforementioned communities you can have parties in the comfort of your own home. 
            The communities that you create can be book/movie/tv-series clubs and you can watch them or read or listen to them at same time.
